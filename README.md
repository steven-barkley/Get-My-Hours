# Get-My-Hours
A cloud-based interactive schedule for Global Security Group. Designed to maximize my hours. 

I will need to create a list of features for the application.

Each employee needs a login
A calendar display needs to be built to display schedules for individual workers but also one for administrators
Needs a database of employees
Hour counter on Employee account

Sketch a complete UX version
= Use the sketchbook first 
- Then use the Digital Program FIGMA
Look for examples online

Set 1 hour a day to work on this or another Capstone project

***Hard to get the focus, ,time ,and will to work*** 1/7/2025 Try again 
**Focus deeply on one skill to master, then execute** Next.js - Kubernetes - DynamoDB etc. 

I missed two full days of contributions!!
I got relaxed and in a habit of work and errands only and forgot to do a simple thing. 
I nearly missed today as well 1/10/2025

Correction I only missed one day. 
Here we go again. Yesterday I spent my time having a lot of fun playing AC 6 and watching YouTube. It was a long week in the cold overnight at work. 
Now let's focus on Building Apps even if it's not this one or something much more simple. Spend focused time doing what is necessary to build a vending machine business of applications that people need. 

Today and tomorrow I have to relax before I am locked into 6 or 7 days a week working. But if the hours are short I can study more and test faster. If the hours or long I earn more and can save faster.  Do more faster.

So I am not contributing to repo or starting on assignment. I don't want to be a B.S. person. I am focused primarily on fitness but I can do incremental work just a bit at a time with the right guide line. I just need the mental strength.

I am sacrificing my future for my present. I work and gym but do not focus on my commits. I only need to do one line of writing and I neglect it. It's only what I deem most important but not what I treat as most important.

I did no studies to on account of my poor sleep schedule and no focus at work consider setting up hours for a specific performance.

I don't know what I am doing. I need to simply and execute ready practice that leads to real outcome. I am burning time. I suck.

Consistency means you do what you planned despite the weather. But I am allowing myself to fail. bndfhdf
